# Zero-Trust Digital Banking: Real-Time Anomaly & Account Takeover Response

## 1. Introduction & Objective

*Securing digital banking requires new answers.* Traditional perimeter-based security and static login rules leave banks hours behind fast-moving fraudsters. Hackers exploit weak authentication, privileged insiders, device spoofing, botnets, and sophisticated account takeover (ATO) schemes. As digital payments accelerate and mobile-first users expect speed, *Zero-Trust Digital Banking* becomes the new imperative—trust no device, user, or session by default, and *verify every request in real-time*.

*Mission:* This project pioneers real-time anomaly detection and ATO response for banking, leveraging granular identity, session, and device intelligence. By transforming standard Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) datasets into high-signal, streaming-ready features, we automate actionable defense—detecting suspicious sessions, locking tokens, and triggering adaptive authentication *instantaneously* rather than hours later. This vision — *proactive detection meets immediate action* — stands to dramatically curtail fraud, protect customer identities, and restore trust.

## 2. Dataset & Preprocessing

#### Data Foundation: Kaggle RBA Dataset

We start with the *Kaggle RBA dataset*, comprising millions of login attempts from a large SSO service. It provides user, session, device, and location features. Raw columns include: [8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasgroup/rba-dataset) 
[9](https://github.com/das-group/rba-algorithm) 


- *userID, timestamp, device info, IP address, geolocation, login result, authentication method*
- Session context: browser, OS, previous login history, and outcome

#### Feature Engineering for Anomaly Detection

To make this actionable for detecting ATO and fraud, we craft additional features:

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Device fingerprinting  | Unique device hashes, browser signature, hardware IDs    |
| IP velocity checks     | IP geolocation changes vs. last login, VPN/proxy flags   |
| Impossible travel      | Calculate travel speed between logins (km/hr), flag if exceeds plausible limits |
| Session context        | Pattern of logins per device/account, cross-device usage |
| Geolocation/time       | Outlier login times (odd hours), country risk scores     |
| Behavioral signals     | Failed login streaks, rapid session turnover, length     |

*Synthetic Data Augmentation:* To overcome class imbalance and expand threat scenarios, we generate synthetic fraud data including:

- Simulated insider threats (privileged access from internal devices)
- Botnet and credential stuffing attempts (mass login attempts from distributed IPs)
- Device emulation (spoofed devices trying to mimic legitimate ones)
- Diffusion models and SMOTE for robust, balanced fraud events [10](https://isij.eu/system/files/download-count/2024-11/5534_Fraud_detection.pdf)

[13](https://www.betterdata.ai/blogs/10-use-cases-for-synthetic-data-in-finance-and-banking)

*Advanced augmentation:* We also simulate multi-account device sharing, VPN location spoofing, promo abuse, and novel session replay tactics.

## 3. Model & Approach

#### Core Classifier Design

For the MVP, models are implemented in **Python** using **scikit-learn** and related libraries.

- *Baseline:* Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, simple Neural Nets
- *Ensemble Methods:* Stacking (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), bagging, boosting, vote classifiers [14](https://www.econjournals.com/index.php/ijefi/article/view/16613) 
[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10050v1) 

- *Semi-Supervised/Unsupervised:* Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, clustering for anomaly detection [16](https://www.fraud.com/post/anomaly-detection) 
[17](https://unit8.com/resources/a-guide-to-building-a-financial-transaction-anomaly-detector/) 
[18](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-does-anomaly-detection-support-fraud-prevention-in-banking)

#### Real-Time/Streaming Inference

- Training and deploying models as RESTful APIs or gRPC microservices with real-time prediction.
- Streaming pipeline support (e.g., Kafka, Flink) for event-driven models.

#### Continuous Trust Evaluation (Zero-Trust Core)

- **Session-level anomaly detection:** Monitor user behavior during sessions (typing/mouse/touch patterns, navigation sequences).  
- **Per-request trust scoring:** Each login, transfer, or action is evaluated independently.  
- **Adaptive MFA prediction:** Trigger MFA only when the risk score suggests probable takeover.  
- **Graph-based signals:** Build account-device-IP graphs to detect fraud rings.  
- **Trust decay model:** Assign decaying “trust tokens” that need reinforcement by normal activity.  
- **Adversarial simulation:** Train models on simulated attacker behaviors (bots, credential stuffing, phishing-origin sessions).  

#### Explainability

Integrate *SHAP* and *LIME* to allow fraud analysts and compliance teams to understand why sessions were flagged, surfacing key features like device changes, abnormal geo-velocity, etc. Provide feature importance and per-instance reasoning for regulatory transparency.[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10050v1)

## 7. Constraints & Challenges

- *Class Imbalance:* Fraud is rare (~0.1–0.2% of logins), demanding sophisticated sampling and synthetic augmentation. [11](https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/mlnews2/reports/Leveraging-synthetic-data-for-tabular-financial-fraud-detection--Vmlldzo3Nzc3Mzk1) 
[12](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/report-using-synthetic-data-in-financial-services.pdf)  
- *False Positives vs. Negatives:* Over-flagging alienates customers; under-flagging invites risk. Authorized, frictionless user experience must be balanced with robust security.  
- *Real-Time Speed vs. Model Complexity:* Fast inference required; ensemble or deep models must be optimized for low-latency streaming.  
- *Privacy & Compliance:* Protecting PII, GDPR requirements; focus on explainable, transparent, auditable ML.  
- *Adversarial Adaptation:* Attackers will attempt to mimic legitimate user behavior. Models must be retrained with adversarial simulation data to resist evasion.

- *Cloud Deployment:* Migrate to AWS/GCP/Azure with serverless (Lambda, Cloud Functions) for scale and uptime.  
- *Streaming Pipeline:* Integrate Kafka/Flink for real-time transaction feed ingestion, parallelized scoring.  
- *Multi-Factor Integration:* Connect with MFA solutions and device attestation for layered defense.  
- *Continuous Training:* Retrain on fresh data, monitor for model drift and adapt to emergent fraud techniques.  
- *User Behavior Analytics (UBA):* Expand feature set to include micro-level behaviors like keystroke timings and device orientation for mobile apps.
