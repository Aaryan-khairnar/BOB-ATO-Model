# Zero-Trust Digital Banking: Real-Time Anomaly & Account Takeover Response

## 1. Introduction & Objective

- Old banking security models don’t work anymore.
- Hackers are faster and more sophisticated.
- Zero-Trust Digital Banking is the answer.

Everyone knows that, but the real problem is that just throwing around 'Zero trust' does not work, we need some real work done in the AI + Banking sector- and that can only be achieved when we combine the following points:

1. We need **Data that matters.** Not just a pile of logins, but rich signals: device fingerprints, session behavior.

2. We need **Multiple smaller AI models** handling different jobs at once to achieve speed.

3. We need a **Suspicion scale** where we plot multiple levels of suspicion. Right now, fraud checks are binary either you’re fine or you’re blocked. We need a system where suspicion is in levels.
- Level 1 suspicion = Customer can enter a few more OTPs and can log into their account. 
- Level 10 suspicion = The account is frozen for the time being and customer is contacted.  
  
This stratergy resolves the problem of **False positives.**

### Mission:
**Catch fraud in real time.**  
We’re turning stale Risk based authentication data into rich, streaming signals—combining identity, session, and device intelligence to spot account takeovers as they happen. The system adapts on the fly, blocking real threats instantly while keeping customers moving.

## 2. Dataset & Preprocessing

#### Data Foundation: Kaggle RBA Dataset

We start with the *Kaggle RBA dataset*, comprising millions of login attempts from a large SSO service. It provides user, session, device, and location features. Raw columns include: 
[8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasgroup/rba-dataset) 
[9](https://github.com/das-group/rba-algorithm) 


- *userID, timestamp, device info, IP address, geolocation, login result, authentication method*
- Session context: browser, OS, previous login history, and outcome

#### Feature Engineering for Anomaly Detection

To make this actionable for detecting ATO and fraud, we craft additional features:

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Device fingerprinting  | Unique device hashes, browser signature, hardware IDs    |
| IP velocity checks     | IP geolocation changes vs. last login, VPN/proxy flags   |
| Impossible travel      | Calculate travel speed between logins (km/hr), flag if exceeds plausible limits |
| Session context        | Pattern of logins per device/account, cross-device usage |
| Geolocation/time       | Outlier login times (odd hours), country risk scores     |
| Behavioral signals     | Failed login streaks, rapid session turnover, length     |

## 3. Model & Approach

#### Core Classifier Design

For the MVP, we’ll start with supervised models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) to build a baseline on labeled RBA data. These are simple, fast to train, and provide a benchmark.

As we progress, we’ll experiment with ensembles (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, stacking) to push performance while balancing speed.

Finally, we’ll explore semi-supervised and unsupervised methods (Isolation Forests, Autoencoders, clustering) to detect novel fraud patterns that supervised models miss. These are harder to tune, but critical for catching emerging threats.

The goal isn’t to use every algorithm, but to iterate: start with proven supervised methods, then layer in ensembles and anomaly detection as the system matures.

#### Continuous Trust Evaluation (Zero-Trust Core)

Instead of granting a long-lived “session pass,” every action gets re-evaluated in real time:
- Session anomaly detection: Track user behavior within a session—typing speed, touch gestures, navigation flow—to flag odd patterns.
- Per-request trust scoring: Each login, transfer, or click is scored independently, no blind trust carried forward.
- Adaptive MFA: Step-up authentication only when the risk model suggests takeover, not as a blanket nuisance.
- Graph intelligence: Link accounts, devices, and IPs to uncover coordinated fraud rings.
- Trust decay: Issue “trust tokens” that weaken over time unless reinforced by normal, safe activity.
- Adversarial training: Expose models to simulated attacks—bots, credential stuffing, phishing-driven sessions—so they learn attacker behavior before it happens in the wild. 

#### How does the model justify itself?

Fraud analysts and compliance teams need clear reasons behind every flagged session—whether it’s a device change, abnormal geo-velocity, or unusual session behavior. Integrating explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) will surface both feature importance and per-instance reasoning, ensuring regulatory transparency and analyst trust.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Pipeline Overview
1. Preprocessing: Clean and balance data; encode categories.
2. Features: Extract device, session, velocity, and behavior signals.
3. Training: Use ensembles + anomaly models with tuning.
4. Evaluation: Track ROC, precision/recall, false positives/negatives.
5. Deployment: Containerized fraud-detection API/microservice.
6. Integration: Hook into login flow, SIEM, and fraud dashboards.

#### Deployment Vision

- *API/Microservice* sits in front of legacy authentication, providing real-time scores and automated responses (token lock, adaptive authentication).
- Dashboard that shows the analyst all the suspicious sessions.
- Integrate alerts and logs with SIEM or banking incident monitoring.

## 5. Features to Build (MVP + Extensions)

- Real-Time ATO Detection – Score logins and sessions instantly; auto-lock tokens and cut off takeover attempts before money moves.
- Velocity & Impossible Travel – Flag logins that jump between continents or through shady VPNs faster than a human could travel.
- Cross-Device Correlation – Detect accounts sharing the same fingerprinted device or IP infrastructure.
- Adaptive Alerts – Notify admins when logins get risky, sessions get challenged, or failures pile up.
- Behavioral Analytics – Watch session dynamics: length, failed logins, typing/mouse/touch quirks (where available).
- Synthetic Fraud Scenarios – Replay credential stuffing, phishing, or botnet attacks to stress-test models.
- Continuous Trust Tokens – Assign decaying trust scores that erode unless reinforced by normal behavior.
- Graph Anomaly Detection – Expose fraud rings by mapping accounts, devices, and IPs as a living network.

## 7. Constraints & Challenges

* **Class Imbalance:** Fraud is rare (\~0.1–0.2% of logins), so we need smart sampling and synthetic data to train effective models.
* **False Positives vs. Negatives:** Too many false alarms frustrate customers; too few let fraud slip through. Balancing security and a smooth user experience is critical.
* **Real-Time vs. Complexity:** Models must run fast in streaming environments—ensembles and deep networks need optimization to avoid slowing down transactions.
* **Privacy & Compliance:** Protect PII and meet GDPR requirements, while keeping ML decisions explainable, auditable, and transparent.
* **Adversarial Adaptation:** Attackers will try to mimic legitimate behavior, so models must be tested and retrained using simulated attacks.

## 8. Known Issues & Next Steps

* **Expand Datasets:** Create richer, context-aware synthetic fraud scenarios covering internal, external, and hybrid attacks.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Move to AWS/GCP/Azure with serverless options for scalability and uptime.
* **Streaming Pipelines:** Integrate Kafka/Flink for real-time transaction ingestion and parallelized scoring.
* **MFA & Device Integration:** Connect adaptive authentication and device attestation for layered defense.
* **Continuous Training:** Retrain models with fresh data, monitor drift, and adapt to emerging fraud techniques.
* **User Behavior Analytics:** Track micro-behaviors like keystrokes, touch gestures, and device orientation in mobile apps.

## 9. Applications Beyond Banking

* **E-Commerce:** Stop account takeovers, credential stuffing, and promo abuse in real time.
* **Enterprise Login Security:** Prevent insider threats, session hijacks, and corporate account abuse.
* **Crypto Exchanges:** Monitor wallets, trades, and money flows for anomalies instantly.

## Vision for the Future

This blueprint moves fraud defense from slow, rules-based systems to proactive, real-time, adaptive protection. By combining identity intelligence, behavioral analytics, device fingerprinting, and ensemble ML, the platform can protect billions in assets and millions of users—*before fraud happens, not after.*

The journey doesn’t stop here. Future expansions include federated learning, graph analytics, deception-based signals, synthetic scenario testing, and explainable AI. The goal: autonomous, transparent, collaborative fraud prevention. This hackathon is just the first step.
